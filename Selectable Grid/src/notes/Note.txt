🧩 Problem Setup

Imagine this grid (4 columns example):

1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9  10  11  12


Here:

column = 4

Boxes are numbered left → right, top → bottom.

We want:

Given a box number (like 7), find which row and column it belongs to.

✅ Step 1 — Convert to zero-based index

Your box numbers start at 1, but math works easier with 0-based indexing.

So:

index = boxNumber - 1


Example:

boxNumber = 7
index = 6

✅ Step 2 — Find the Row

Each row contains exactly column items.

So:

row = how many full rows fit before this index?


That is integer division:

row = Math.floor(index / column)

Example (box 7):
index = 6
column = 4

row = Math.floor(6 / 4)
row = Math.floor(1.5)
row = 1   ✅ (second row, since row starts from 0)

✅ Step 3 — Find the Column

Column is simply the remainder when dividing by number of columns:

col = index % column

Example (box 7):
col = 6 % 4
col = 2   ✅ (third column, zero-based)

🎯 Final Result

For box 7:

Row = 1
Col = 2
